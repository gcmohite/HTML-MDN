    <h1><strong>Important notice</strong></h1>
    <p>
      On Sunday January 9th 2010, a <em>gang</em> of goths were spotted stealing
      <em>several</em> garden gnomes from a shopping center in downtown
      Milwaukee. They were all
      <strong>wearing green jumpsuits and silly hats</strong>, and seemed to be
      having a whale of a time. If anyone has any information about this
      incident, <strong>please contact the police </strong> now.
